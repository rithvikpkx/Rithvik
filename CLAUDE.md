# CLAUDE.md

Guidance for Claude Code when working in this repo. Project: a personal portfolio for **Rithvik Praveen Kumar**, deployed to [rithvik.ai](https://rithvik.ai), built as a one-stop showcase plus an experimental playground for live editing + an AI chatbot.

## Stack

- **Next.js 16** (App Router), React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind v4 (CSS in `app/globals.css`)
- **Supabase** (Postgres + Auth) — `@supabase/ssr` for cookie-based sessions, `@supabase/supabase-js` server admin client
- **Motion** (`motion/react`) for animation
- **LangChain** (`@langchain/openai`) for the planned RAG bot in `app/api/chat`
- Deployed on **Vercel** (`dev` branch deploys preview, `main` deploys production)

Node 22, package manager: npm. `npm run dev` / `npm run build` / `npm run lint`.

## Rules (carried from earlier)

- Keep design philosophy simple. Architecture minimal and clean.
- Each function: 1–2 sentence description as a comment.
- Confusing or non-obvious lines: 1 short inline comment explaining WHY.
- Develop in **vertical slices** across the full stack — keep work visible and testable end-to-end.
- Self-test before claiming done. `node_modules/.bin/tsc --noEmit` is the cheapest gate; visual check on Vercel preview is the next.

## High-level architecture

### Page composition

`app/page.tsx` is a server component. It fetches `site_content` once and passes parsed/typed props down to client section components. Each section (`Hero`, `Bento`, `Education`, `Projects`, `Experience`, `Contact`) renders the same way for visitors but adapts to edit mode via `useEditMode()`.

### Server / client section split

Sections backed by their own table (`Projects`, `Experience`, `Education`) use a two-file pattern:

- `ComponentName.tsx` — server component, fetches the rows from Supabase, renders the section wrapper and section header, passes `initialRows` to a client component.
- `ComponentNameClient.tsx` — `"use client"`, owns local state, runs the edit-mode UI (sort buttons, add/delete, inline `EditableText` for each field, `EditableTagList` for tag arrays). Public view in this same component when `isEditing === false`.

Sections that just read keys from `site_content` (`Hero`, `Bento`, `Contact`) are single client components that take their content as props and use `useEditMode()` to swap to `EditableText` when editing.

### Theme system (`lib/themes.ts`, `components/ThemeProvider.tsx`, `components/ThemeStyleInjector.tsx`, `components/ThemeDial.tsx`)

Themes are rows in the `themes` table. Each row has a `tokens` JSONB column. **Only the primary palette is per-theme**:

`bg, bg-soft, text, muted, accent, accent-glow, green` (plus optional `font`).

Surface tokens are **derived in CSS via `color-mix()`**:

- `--card`, `--card-hover`, `--border`, `--border-hover` — `color-mix(in srgb, var(--text) X%, transparent)`
- `--nav-glass` — `color-mix(in srgb, var(--bg) 72%, transparent)`
- `--panel-glass` — `color-mix(in srgb, var(--bg) 90%, transparent)`

So **adding a new theme is one DB row** — define the 7 primary tokens and every surface adapts automatically. No CSS changes required.

At SSR, `ThemeStyleInjector` renders one `<style id="theme-tokens">` block containing `:root[data-theme="<slug>"] { … }` for every theme. The active theme is set on `<html data-theme="…">` by:
1. `<html data-theme="rithvik-dark">` hardcoded in JSX (works with JS disabled).
2. An inline boot script at the top of `<body>` that reads `localStorage[rithvik-theme]` and overwrites the attribute **before first paint** — no FOUC.

`ThemeProvider` wraps the app, exposes `useTheme()` → `{ themes, currentSlug, setTheme }`. `setTheme` is an **instant flip** — it writes `localStorage`, swaps `<html data-theme>`, and updates `currentSlug`. There is no page-wide transition animation.

### Theme transition (instant flip + live dial rotation)

The only animation on a theme change is the dial pill rotation itself. The page-wide colors swap instantly — every CSS-var-driven surface (bg, text, borders, glass tints, etc.) repaints in the new theme on the next frame.

- **Dial rotation** (`.theme-strip-option { transition: transform 0.42s cubic-bezier(0.32, 0.72, 0, 1) }`) — each pill's `transform: translate(0, calc(-50% + Y)) rotate(Xdeg)` recomputes whenever `selectedIdx` changes; CSS interpolates it. The fan rotates smoothly as one cohesive unit while the rest of the page has already snapped to the new theme.

Earlier iterations tried two transition animations and we rolled both back:
- **View Transitions API** with per-pill `view-transition-name` — pulled pills out of the dial's `overflow: hidden` clipping (named groups aren't clipped by their parent's overflow) and interpolated their bounding boxes rather than their transforms, so pills snapped to the new rotation at t=0 and only slid linearly.
- **`<ThemeWash>` overlay** with delayed `data-theme` swap — a glass wave sweeping from the dial across the viewport, with the `data-theme` flip hidden behind the opaque crest. Looked busy; the instant flip reads cleaner.

### Inline editing (`feat-inline-editing.md`, completed)

- `EditModeProvider` (client) owns `isEditing`, `panelOpen`, Supabase session, login/logout
- Session policy: stays alive **per tab** (`sessionStorage` flag `rithvik-tab-auth`); closing the tab clears it so the next tab requires fresh login. The Supabase session itself is not signed out on "exit edit mode" — so re-entering the dial doesn't reopen the login panel
- `InlineLoginPanel` — top-right glass card, springs from the nav button
- `EditBar` — bottom floating indicator with "Exit editing"
- `EditableText` — `contentEditable` wrapper, saves on blur, Escape reverts, Enter blurs unless `multiline`
- `EditableTagList` — chip editor (× on each, input adds on Enter/comma/blur)
- Server actions in `app/admin/actions.ts` — `createProject/updateProject/deleteProject`, same for Experience, `updateEducation`, `upsertSiteContent`. Every action calls `requireAuth()` (reads cookie session) and `revalidatePath("/")`

### Important Supabase gotcha

The browser client in `lib/supabase.ts` MUST be `createBrowserClient` from `@supabase/ssr` (NOT `createClient` from `@supabase/supabase-js`). Only the SSR version stores sessions in cookies — the plain client uses localStorage, which server actions can't read, so `requireAuth()` would redirect every save call to `/admin/login`. This was a real bug.

## Database

Tables (all in Supabase public schema):

- `projects` — portfolio projects
- `experience` — timeline rows
- `education` — schools (single-row Purdue today)
- `site_content` — key/value JSONB store for hardcoded text that became editable (`hero.tagline`, `hero.sub_line`, `bento.location`, `bento.building`, `bento.stats`, `bento.stack`, `bento.interests`, `contact.headline`, `contact.sub`, optional `contact.link.{github,linkedin,email}`)
- `themes` — `{ slug, name, tokens (JSONB), sort_order, published }`. Currently seeded: Rithvik Dark, Rithvik Light, Rithvik Terminal

RLS: all tables `SELECT` public; INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE use the service-role key only in server actions.

### Migration files (apply via Supabase SQL editor)

- `supabase/stage3_migration.sql` — education table + site_content seed (inline-editing stage 3)
- `supabase/themes_migration.sql` — themes table + Dark/Light/Terminal seed (idempotent ON CONFLICT)
- `supabase/themes_add_terminal.sql` — UPSERT just the Terminal row (run if other themes already exist)

## File layout cheat sheet

```
app/
  layout.tsx          — fetches themes, renders ThemeStyleInjector + FOUC script + ThemeProvider + EditModeProvider
  page.tsx            — fetches site_content; passes to Hero/Bento/Contact; renders all sections
  globals.css         — tokens, dial, all the rest
  admin/
    actions.ts        — server actions for all tables (still used; the /admin UI pages are deprecated)
    login/, logout/   — legacy pages, replaced by InlineLoginPanel; kept for fallback
    page.tsx          — legacy dashboard, deprecated
  api/chat/           — RAG bot endpoint (in progress)

components/
  Nav.tsx, Footer.tsx, Hero.tsx, Bento.tsx, Education(.tsx + Client.tsx),
  Projects(.tsx + Client.tsx), Experience(.tsx + Client.tsx), Contact.tsx
  EditModeProvider.tsx, InlineLoginPanel.tsx, EditBar.tsx
  EditableText.tsx, EditableTagList.tsx
  ThemeProvider.tsx, ThemeStyleInjector.tsx, ThemeDial.tsx
  FadeIn.tsx, KineticText.tsx, FlickeringGrid.tsx, TimelineBeam.tsx, LocalTime.tsx, EduLogo.tsx
  RagBot.tsx          — chatbot UI (the brain is in app/api/chat)

lib/
  supabase.ts         — clients (browser uses createBrowserClient)
  themes.ts           — token list, fallback tokens, buildThemeStyleSheet
  types.ts            — Project, Experience, Education, SiteContent, Theme, Database

plans/
  feat-inline-editing.md  — done (stages 1–8 shipped, merged to main as v1.1)
  feat-theme.md           — stages 1–7 done; stage 8 (mobile polish + cleanup) remains
```

## Pitfalls learned the hard way

- **Don't add a page-wide transition animation to the theme swap.** Two prior approaches were rolled back: (a) `document.startViewTransition` freezes the live DOM during the transition, so per-pill CSS rotation can't visibly play, and per-element `view-transition-name` pulls children out of their parent's `overflow: hidden` clipping while interpolating bounding boxes rather than transforms; (b) a custom glass-wash overlay with a delayed `data-theme` flip worked mechanically but read as visually busy. The instant flip + live pill rotation is the chosen architecture.
- **`setPointerCapture` on `pointerdown` breaks button clicks** — the click target is redirected from the inner button to the captured container. Only call `setPointerCapture` once you've confirmed an actual drag (movement past a threshold).
- **React's `onWheel` is passive from v17+** — `e.preventDefault()` doesn't work. To intercept the wheel for the theme dial cycling, attach via `addEventListener("wheel", h, { passive: false })` in a `useEffect`.

## Dead / legacy code

- `app/admin/{login,logout,page.tsx,ExperienceManager.tsx,ProjectManager.tsx}` — pre-inline-editing dashboard. Kept as fallback while the inline flow stabilizes; safe to delete once happy.

## Where to look first when something breaks

- Theme not switching → check the browser console for React errors from `ThemeProvider`. Check `localStorage.getItem("rithvik-theme")`. Try forcing `document.documentElement.dataset.theme = "rithvik-light"` in devtools to isolate CSS issues.
- Edit-mode save redirects to `/admin/login` → the browser client probably isn't `createBrowserClient` (cookie mismatch with server actions).
- Dial rotation doesn't animate → confirm `.theme-strip-option` still has `transition: transform 0.42s ...` and that pills do NOT have any `view-transition-name` style.
- A theme is missing from the dial → run `supabase/themes_migration.sql` (or `themes_add_terminal.sql` for just Terminal). Verify with `SELECT slug FROM themes;`.

## What's still open

- Feat-theme **stage 8** — mobile polish, accessibility verification, cleanup of any remaining dead code.
- RAG bot — `api/chat` route + `RagBot.tsx` UI; not yet integrated end-to-end.
- Decision pending on whether to remove the legacy `/admin/*` pages entirely.
